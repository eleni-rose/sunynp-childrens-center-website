## SUNY New Paltz Children's Center - a dynamic website built with PHP, MySQL, and TailwindCSS.
Built during the Spring 2023 semester at SUNY New Paltz for our senior project.

While it has all of the basic functionality of a static web page like our client requested, we also integrated dynamic data features including a registration and login system for future administrator users to allow easy maintenance of the website. The needs of the Children's Center change at minimum on a yearly basis with the need for new file uploads for their Handbook Policies, but we also wanted administrators to be able to make quick, easy changes for their staff and home page so they can easily keep current.

Aside from CRUD features for their staff, gallery, and slideshow components, we also integrated a secure SMTP contact form using the PHPMailer package which will allow our client to easily receive and reply to inquiries sent right through the form.
