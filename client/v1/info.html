        <h2> ABOUT US </h2>
        <p>
            The Children's Center is a licensed, non-profit corporation. In addition to tuition, the center is partially
            funded by SUNY grants and by the Student Association of SUNY New Paltz. The facility, plus maintenance and
            utilities, is provided by the College free of charge. We appreciate the upkeep and maintenance the College
            provides. Our primary purpose is to provide quality care for children of students attending classes at SUNY
            New Paltz.
            <br> <br>
            Our primary concern is the social and emotional development of each child. We strive to provide a loving and
            secure environment which encourages cooperation, self-expression and respect for others. Our daily
            curriculum provides activities such as free play, arts and crafts, music, story telling, and outdoor play.
            Through various activities we try to foster a curiosity and respect for nature and for all the different
            cultures in the world around us. All themes are presented in an age appropriate, relaxed and fun-filled way.
            Our program is based on non-competitive, non-sexist and multicultural values. Most importantly we seek to
            respect the freedom of each child while providing structure and direction.
